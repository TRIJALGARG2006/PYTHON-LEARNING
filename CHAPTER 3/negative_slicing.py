name = "trijal"

print (name[1:4])  
# for ex 
print (name[-5:-2])
# if you wanna slice more than 5 then keep adding -1 values to the corresponding values 
# you will get the same output
# you can also use this output 
print(name[:4]) # this is the same as (name[0:4])
print(name[0:]) # same print as (name [1:6]) simply put it will print form start to full end
