NAME = "TRIJAL"

name_short = NAME[0:6] #this is indexing . in this your first value starts from 0 
# and ends with -1 . so here 0 will be t and 5 will be L . 
# if i write 0:5 then it wont print the 5th word but it will print 0 
print(name_short)
#so for example 


character1 = NAME[2]
print(character1)
