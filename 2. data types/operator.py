print(round(x)) #round will make the value of x without the float integers 

print(abs(y)) #it will make the y positive or return it wihtout the sign

print(pow(z , 3)) # this will put a power on top of z of 3 

print(max(x,y,z)) # this will the return the max from x,y,z which is z and there is min
